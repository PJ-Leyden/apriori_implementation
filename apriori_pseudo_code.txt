Apriori

Let ck represent the series of subsequent candidate sets where k = length of the contained candidate sets.
Let fk represent the series of subsequent frequent sets where k = length of the contained candidate sets. 
Let 'sets' represent the set of all itemsets

//Generate the initial candidate set
for each set in sets
	for each item in set
		if item is unique
			add to c1


//iterate through the candidate set and check for frequency against database
for c1_itr = c1.begin; cl_itr != c1.end; ++c1_itr
	count = 0
	for each set in sets
		i1 = c1_itr->begin
		i2 = set.begin
		while i2 != set.end AND i1 != cl_itr->end
			if(i1 == i2)
				++i1
			++i2
		if i1 == cl_itr->end
			count++
